Week 5

Remix of Daren Bartolucci's "Atlantic jodhpur": https://editor.p5js.org/dbartolu/sketches/nXcD-nGTL

* Share your most-recent homework with your classmates

* Choose a sketch from a classmate that you wish to `remix`

* Use their code as a starting point for your second sound project

* Refactor, encapsulate, modify, add-to, and tweak the original code until you feel it has become 'something else' - until it feels like something you made.

* Submit a link to the original sketch and a link to your remix sketch in Canvas. Share a link to your `remix` with the original author.
